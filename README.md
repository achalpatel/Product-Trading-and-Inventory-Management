# Product Trading and Inventory Management

•	A website to connect Wholesalers and Retailers by providing the facility to trade products, manage inventory and tracking sales by Time series forecasting and performing data analysis.

•	A feature that would suggest refilling the inventory only when it’s needed; in order to continue the business without overstocking by forecasting the sales patterns of individual products.
